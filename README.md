# Minishell
Minishell is a minimalistic shell implementation developed as part of the 42 school curriculum. The project focuses on creating a basic shell with essential functionalities such as command execution, pipe handling, and environment variable management.

## About the Project
Minishell is a simple Unix shell that mimics the behavior of a standard shell. It supports fundamental shell operations like executing commands, handling pipes, and managing environment variables. The goal is to understand and implement basic shell features and learn about process management and inter-process communication.

## This project was designed to:
- Implement a simple shell with command execution.
- Handle pipes for inter-process communication.
- Manage environment variables and command-line arguments.
- Process and execute built-in commands.

## Features
- **Command Execution:** Run external programs and commands.
- **Pipe Handling:**  Support for pipes to connect multiple commands.
